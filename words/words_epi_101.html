<h2 id="toc_1">COVID-19 Futures, Explained With Playable Simulations</h2>

<p>&quot;The only thing to fear is fear itself&quot; was stupid advice.</p>

<p>If people fear fear itself, they&#39;ll deny danger because they don&#39;t want to create &quot;mass panic&quot;. The problem&#39;s not fear, but how we <em>use</em> our fear. Fear, used well, gives you energy to deal with current dangers, and prepare for future dangers.</p>

<p>Honestly, the two of us (Marcel, epidemiologist + Nicky, artist/coder) are worried about the future. We bet you are, too. That&#39;s why we want to channel <em>our</em> worries into making these <strong>playable simulations</strong>, so that you can channel <em>your</em> worries into understanding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Last Few Months</strong> (epidemiology 101, SEIR model, R &amp; R<sub>0</sub>)</li>
<li><strong>The Next Few Months</strong> (lockdowns, contact tracing, masks)</li>
<li><strong>The Next Few Years</strong> (vaccines, loss of immunity?)</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide is meant to give you hope <em>and</em> fear. To beat this virus <strong>in a way that also protects our mental &amp; financial health</strong>, we need optimism to create plans, and pessimism to create backup plans. As Gladys Bronwyn Stern once said, <em>“The optimist invents the airplane and the pessimist the parachute.”</em></p>

<p>So, buckle in: we&#39;re about to experience some turbulence.</p>

<hr>

<h1 id="toc_2">The Last Few Months</h1>

<p>Pilots use flight simulators to learn how not to crash planes.</p>

<p><strong>Epidemiologists use epidemic simulators to learn how not to crash humanity.</strong></p>

<p>So, let&#39;s create a very simple &quot;epidemic flight simulator&quot;! Here, we have some (i) Infectious people &amp; some not-yet-infected (s) Susceptible people. (i)s turn (s)s into more (i)s:</p>

<p>// pic</p>

<p>At the start of a COVID-19 outbreak, it&#39;s estimated that the virus jumps from an (i) to an (s) every 4 days.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (<em>On average.</em> Remember, there&#39;s lots of variation.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simulation of a population with <em>just</em> 0.001% (i) and 99.999% (s), over 6 months. If we simulate &quot;double every 4 days&quot; <em>and nothing else</em>, what happens?</p>

<p><strong>Click &quot;Start&quot; to play the simulation! (Afterwards, you can re-play the simulation with different settings)</strong></p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>This is the <strong>exponential growth curve.</strong> Starts small, then explodes. &quot;Oh it&#39;s just a flu&quot; to &quot;Oh right, flus don&#39;t create <em>mass graves in rich cities</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>// pic - exponential double rice</p>

<p>But, this simulation is wrong. Exponential growth, thankfully, can&#39;t go on forever. One thing that stops a virus from spreading is if others <em>already</em> have the virus:</p>

<p>// pic - 100% spread, 50% spread, 0% spread</p>

<p><strong>The more (i)s there are, the faster (s)s become (i)s, but the fewer (s)s there are, the <em>slower</em> (s)s become (i)s.</strong></p>

<p>Now, what happens if we simulate that?</p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>This is the &quot;S-shaped&quot; <strong>logistic growth curve.</strong> Starts small, explodes, then slows down again.</p>

<p>But, this simulation is <em>still</em> wrong. We&#39;re missing the fact that (i) Infectious people eventually stop being infectious, either by 1) recovering, 2) &quot;recovering&quot; with lung damage, or 3) dying.</p>

<p>For simplicity&#39;s sake, let&#39;s pretend that all (i) Infectious people become (r) Recovered. (r)s can&#39;t be infected again, and let&#39;s pretend – <em>for now!</em> – that they stay immune for life.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re infected with COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated you stay (i) infectious for 12 days.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (Again, <em>on average.</em>)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simulation that starts with 100% (i). Most people recover after 12 days, then most of the remainder recover after another 12 days, then most of the remainder <em>of that remainder</em> recover after another 12 days, etc:</p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>This is the opposite of exponential growth, the <strong>exponential decay curve</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, what happens if you combine this with the S-shaped logistic curve of infection?</p>

<p>// pic</p>

<p>Let&#39;s find out. Here&#39;s a simulation of an epidemic <em>with</em> recovery:</p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>And <em>that&#39;s</em> where that famous curve comes from! It&#39;s not a bell curve, it&#39;s not even a &quot;log-normal&quot; curve. It has no name. But you&#39;ve seen it a zillion times, and beseeched to flatten.</p>

<p>// pic: 3 rules</p>

<p>This is the the <strong>SIR Model</strong>, ((s) <strong>S</strong>usceptible → (i) <strong>I</strong>nfectious →  (r) <strong>R</strong>ecovered) the second-most important idea in Epidemiology 101.</p>

<p>Note: The simulations that inform policy are <em>far</em> more sophisticated than this! But the SIR model can still help us understand a lot about COVID-19, even if missing the nuances.</p>

<p>Actually, let&#39;s add one more nuance: before an (s) becomes an (i), they first become an (e) Exposed person, when they&#39;re infect<em>ed</em> but not yet infect<em>ious</em> – they have the virus but can&#39;t pass it on (yet).</p>

<p>(This variant is called the <strong>SEIR Model</strong>, where &quot;E&quot; stands for (e) Exposed. Note this <em>isn&#39;t</em> the everyday meaning of &quot;exposed&quot;, where you might or might not have the virus. In this technical definition, &quot;Exposed&quot; means you definitely have it. Yeah, science terminology is bad.)</p>

<p>For COVID-19, it&#39;s estimated that you&#39;re in this &quot;latent period&quot; for around 3 days.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> What happens if we add that to the simulation?</p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>Not much, actually! The &quot;latent period&quot; only changes <em>when</em> the peak happens, but the <em>height</em> of the peak – and total people infected – remain the same:</p>

<p>// pics</p>

<p>Why&#39;s that? Because of the <em>first</em>-most important idea in Epidemiology 101:</p>

<p>// pic - <strong>&quot;R&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Which is short for &quot;Reproduction Number&quot;. It&#39;s the <em>average</em> number of people an (i) infects <em>before</em> they recover (or die).</p>

<p>// R &gt; 1, R = 1, R &lt; 1 pic</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> changes over the course of an outbreak, as we get more immunity &amp; interventions.</p>

<p><strong>R<sub>0</sub></strong> (pronounced R-nought) is what R is <em>at the start of an outbreak, before immunity or interventions</em>. R<sub>0</sub> is also called the &quot;basic reproduction number&quot;. R<sub>0</sub> more closely reflects the power of the virus itself, but it still changes from place to place. For example, because heat &#39;kills&#39; coronaviruses, R<sub>0</sub> for COVID-19 is lower in hot places than cold ones. Not low enough to contain it, though.</p>

<p>(A lot of news outlets – and even academic papers! – confuse R and R<sub>0</sub>. Again, science terminology is bad.)</p>

<p>The R<sub>0</sub> for the flu<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> is around 1.3. The R<sub>0</sub> estimates for COVID-19 are usually between 2 and 3, maybe as high as 6.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In our simulations, an (i) recovers in 12 days, but infects one new (s) every 4 days. That means, <em>on average</em>, an (i) infects 3 (s)s before they recover. So for our simulations, R<sub>0</sub> is 3.</p>

<p><strong>Play around with this R<sub>0</sub> calculator, to see how R<sub>0</sub> depends on recovery time &amp; new-infection time:</strong></p>

<p>// calc</p>

<p>But remember, the fewer (s)s there are, the <em>slower</em> (s)s become (i)s. 
R depends not just on R<sub>0</sub>, but also how many people are no longer Susceptible – due to, say, having recovered &amp; gotten natural immunity.</p>

<p>// calc 2</p>

<p>When enough people have natural immunity, R &lt; 1, and the virus is contained! This is called <strong>herd immunity</strong>, and while it&#39;s <em>terrible</em> policy, (we&#39;ll explain why later – it&#39;s not for the reason you may think!) it&#39;s essential to understanding Epidemiology 101.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s play the last simulation again, but showing R<sub>0</sub>, R over time, and the herd immunity threshold:</p>

<p>// sim</p>

<p>Note: Total cases (the gray curve) does not stop at herd immunity, but <em>overshoots</em> it! And it does this <em>exactly when</em> current cases (the pink curve) peaks. This happens no matter how you change the settings:</p>

<p>// pic</p>

<p>This is because, by definition, when there are more non-(s)s than the herd immunity threshold, you get R &lt; 1. And, by definition, R &lt; 1 means new cases stop growing.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s only one lesson you take away from this whole guide, here it is, in big shiny letters:</p>

<h1 id="toc_3">R &gt; 1 = bad</h1>

<h1 id="toc_4">R &lt; 1 = good (R=1, meh)</h1>

<p><strong>This means: we do NOT need to catch all transmissions, or even nearly all transmissions, to stop COVID-19!</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a paradox. COVID-19 is incredibly contagious, yet to contain it, we &quot;only&quot; need to stop 67% of infections. 67%?! If that was a school grade, that&#39;s a D+. But if R<sub>0</sub> = 3, cutting that by 67% gives us R = 0.99, which is R &lt; 1, which means the virus is contained!</p>

<p>(And even if, extreme-worst-case, R<sub>0</sub> = <em>6</em>, you still &quot;only&quot; need to stop 84% of transmissions. That&#39;s a B grade.)</p>

<p>// calculator - custom</p>

<p><em>Every</em> COVID-19 intervention you&#39;ve heard of – handwashing, social distancing, lockdowns, self-isolation, contact tracing &amp; quarantining, face masks, even &quot;herd immunity&quot; – they&#39;re <em>all</em> doing the same thing:</p>

<p>Getting R &lt; 1.</p>

<p>So now, let&#39;s use our &quot;epidemic flight simulator&quot; to figure out the next few months! How will we get R &lt; 1 in a way that protects not just our physical health, <strong>but also our mental health, social health, <em>and</em> financial health?</strong></p>

<p>Brace yourselves for an emergency landing...</p>
